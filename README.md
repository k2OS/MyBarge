<h1>MyBarge</h1>
I want to built a remote controlled vehicle.. and I want it to be operating in water, 
and I'd like to equip it with a downfacing camera and ultimately the means to retrieve 
sunken disc golf discs.

The controls are heavily influenced by (read: I copied it it directly) 
The Pepsi Bottle RC Boat ( https://github.com/shane-taurean/Pepsi_Bottle_RC_Boat ) using different libraries for communications, but essentially the controls are the same..

See https://labitat.dk/wiki/MyBarge for details such as pictures and more as they arrive.

Hardware (the not-complete-list):
- 2x Arduino (1 for remote and one for operating the boat)
- 1x PS2 joystick module (5v, ebay)
- 1x L293D DC motor controller
- 2x nRF2401 modules, with antennae (ebay)
- various batterypacks and dc-converters for power
- various materials for the platform.. initally just for a land-operated robot.
